Version 17.4.76.300
  - Toast message on device connection changed to "New Thunderbolt™ device has been connected. Click here to approve the device." 
    The notification time has been extended to remain around 25 seconds at the minimum.
  - Fixed MUP errors popped up with CVT2.0.1

Version 17.4.75.250
  - Implements RTD3 RCR:
    * When the platform is RTD3 capable (BIOS & FW) the driver will enable it automatically on each driver load.
      It would be reflected on the Thunderbolt controller Power Management tab. 
    * Changed FW Update SDK accordingly to expose RTD3 capability (including SDK API, documentation and sample)       
  - Fixed potential Bugcheck when resuming from Sx while Thunderbolt networking connection is active (see fixed issue #1604754624)
  - Fixed another corner case addressing issue #1604629561
  
Version 17.3.74.400
  - Hotfix: Bugcheck E1 observed during S3,S4 & WR cycle (Pointing to Ntkrnlmp.exe) (see fixed issue #1604664744)

Version 17.3.73.350
  - Hotfix: Race condition between Service Shutdown and OS Sx entry flow (see fixed issue #1604629561)

Version 17.3.72.250
  - Added support for Titan Ridge host controllers (JHL7540 & JHL7340)
  - Added support for PRE-BOOT ACL feature (deprecating previous implementation from 17.1.64.250):
      Devices that can be used for boot or during pre-boot need to be pre-approved. 
      Pre-Boot ACL solution enables device pre boot approval by maintaining an access control list in the FW as well
  - Fixed race condition issues for supporting Selective Suspend (RTD3) state (refer to fixed issues #4927597 and #4927596 for more details)

Version 17.2.71.250
  - Added support for Windows* 10 RS3 Native PCIe Enumeration ("Native Express" mode) and Selective Suspend (RTD3) state.
  - Added support to enable Firmware Update on host controller in USB only mode (Device ID 0x15DC, 0x15DD and 0x15DE).
  - Added support for firmware update on device based on TR-DD (JHL 7440) controller - Including SDK and sample update
  - System Tray application reports software & firmware component versions in a separate menu option that does not require Admin permission.
  - Added UEFI capsule update reference code for Host controller Firmware Update in SDK sample folder
  - Optimized Installer Package for Thunderbolt Software, reducing its size significantly (less than 10Mb)
  - Toast notification improvement, now based on the Action Center instead of persistent notification in the right bottom corner of the screen.
  - This package does not support the PRE-BOOT ACL feature introduced in previous software package 17.1.x
  - Thunderbolt Networking is now working properly with Microsoft Windows bridge functionality (Windows* 10 RS3 required)
  
Version 17.1.64.250
  - Initial support for Windows* 10 RS2 Native Enumeration (FWU SDK and samples updated accordingly as well).
  - Added support for PRE-BOOT ACL feature: 
      Devices that can be used for boot or during pre-boot need to be pre-approved. 
      Pre-Boot ACL solution enables device pre boot approval by maintaining an access control list in the BIOS. 
      ACL is maintained by both the SW and the BIOS.
      Main “use case” flow:
        1. User adds one or some entries to the ACL through the TBT SW
        2. TBT SW downloads the ACL into BIOS
        3. On boot, BIOS communicates the ACL to TBT FW
        4. FW can identify connected devices and authorize them in Pre-boot stage
        5. At OS up, TBT SW gets indication on presence of  pre-boot authorized device
  - Added support for Apple* Boot Camp in Secure Connect mode (SL1)
  - Firmware Policy settings window has been removed
  - No more support for older Thunderbolt 1 and 2 host controllers

Fixed Issues
============
Version 17.4.77.400
2202117254 Connection of a device while system just entered RTD3 causes hotplug event to be missed
	   Device doesn't appear in TBT SW as consequence.
	
Version 17.4.75.250
1604754624  Very sporadic Bugcheck 7E observed during S4 cycling while P2P is connected 

Version 17.3.74.400
1604664744  Bugcheck E1 observed during S3,S4 & WR cycle (Pointing to Ntkrnlmp.exe)
            due to race condition on spinlock

Version 17.3.73.350
1604629561  Thunderbolt 3 Device fails to enumerate when plug in S0 after resume from S3/S4, 
            when the device is unplugged in S3/S4 entry transition

Version 17.3.72.250
4927595 Sporadically, when "Fast Startup" mode is enabled and system is shutdown while a device is connected,
        this device will not enumerate and show up in device manager on system restart

4927597 In "Secure Connect" mode (a.k.a. SL2), while the Thunderbolt host controller is in Selective Suspend (RTD3) state,
        moving two or more authorized devices to the ACL (by choosing "always connect") will succeed only for the first device.

4927590 Thunderbolt topology is not correctly refreshed in the UI Application while resuming from Sleep (S3 or S4) if chain of 
        authorized devices is disconnected during Sx state. This occurs only if the UI application is left opened before the 
        Sx transition.        

4927596 Error 0x100 FW_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT or 0x3 GENERAL_ERROR is returned when trying to perform Firmware Update while the Thunderbolt
        host controller is in Selective Suspend (RTD3) state

Version 17.1.64.250
4926127 In this version the SW stack goes down when the last device is disconnected. However, 
        the system tray application will stay up if the last device is disconnected within a few
        seconds of the user changing the settings. 
        This issue is not relevant anymore since the FW Policy settings form is no more accessible.

4927271 GUI tree is reported as empty after cold boot to OS while devices are connected.


Version 16.2.52.250
4926352 When security level is "Secure Connect", after disconnecting and reconnecting devices while
        the PC is in sleep mode, the authorization window will not automatically open but the devices
        still need to be re-authorized.

4926536 Application GUI does not pop up on device hot-plug after initial package installation.

4926798 Thunderbolt.exe is managed code and will have impact on boot time even if the Systray 
        Application should not be running (e.g. no Thunderbolt device is connected).

4927148 Once a Thunderbolt networking session is established, restarting one peer may leave the 
        Connection Status of the remote peer to be reported incorrectly as well as the Thunderbolt 
        Networking menu being greyed out, even if the networking functionality is still working.

4927198 Once a Thunderbolt networking session is established, the GUI tree may be not showing the 
        remote peer after this one is restarted.

4927150 In some timing race conditions the Systray Application icon does not appear, and should 
        be launched manually.

4927195 A device white listed in Security Level 1 (i.e. "User Authorization") will not be authorized
        when moving to Security Level 2 (i.e. "Secure Connect") until it is removed from the white list
        and reinserted.

4927199 When no Thunderbolt Controller is present, running manually the Thunderbolt Software may 
        report incorrectly a need for Firmware Update.

4927217 No authorization window appear for device approval after Sx resume when "Wake on Thunderbolt"
        is disabled in BIOS.

4927179 In some languages (ENU, JPN, PTB) the eGPU toast notification is truncated.

4927205 Systray Application does not start after restarting the PC with Thunderbolt Device connected.

4927227 After performing INF upgrade, the Thunderbolt SW is indeed not installed.

4926842 Upon Thunderbolt networking connection, it is possible to delete the peer icon located on the
        desktop, however it will be restored on desktop refresh (pressing F5)


Known Issues
============
4926928 Concurrent install/upgrade can lead the Thunderbolt Software to be partially installed if it is 
        run unattended while another MSI process is already running. In such a case the Thunderbolt
        software should be removed and re-installed.

4927310 Connecting a Thunderbolt device in the middle of the Thunderbolt Software installation process
        may lead the software to miss the automatic launch when installation is done. 
        Disconnecting the device for at least 10sec and reconnecting it will trigger the software again.
        
Limitations
============
   -  The Thunderbolt Networking implementation does not support Link aggregation (a.k.a. NIC teaming) 
      via the OS.
